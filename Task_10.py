# 55. Epoch Info and Conversion
#
# The epoch is the point where time starts, and is platform dependent.
# For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). Write a Python program to find out what the epoch is on a given platform.
# Convert a given time in seconds since the epoch.
#
# Sample Output:
# Epoch on a given platform:
# time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)
# Time in seconds since the epoch:
# time.struct_time(tm_year=1970, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=1, tm_hour=10, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=1, tm_isdst=0)
from datetime import datetime
import  time
today=datetime.now()
print(time.gmtime(0))
print(time.gmtime(36000))
print(f" Current epoch time:{today.timetuple()}")
